# Frontend of the challenge

## Responsabilities

Frontend responsibilities in this project are:

- Comunication with backend, returning transactions and sellers data, and uploading the sales file
- Provide a simple UI to the final user
- facilitate the access to the data

## Technologies

- NextJS 13.5.4
- React ^18
- Cypress "^13.3.1
- Typescript ^5
- Tailwind ^3

## Environment Variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` - Backend URL, like `http://localhost:8000`

## Setup

### Docker

First, build the project preferably with [Docker BuildX](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx/).

```
docker buildx build --tag frontend-challange-hubla .
```

If you can't use Docker BuildX, use the traditional build command.

```
docker build --tag frontend-challange-hubla .
```

And run with the backend database URL.

```
docker run -i -p 5000:5000 --env BACKEND_URL="[URL]" backend-challange-hubla
```

### NPM

You can also start with NPM:

> Default

```
npm run start
```

> Development

```
npm run dev
```

Development mode will only enable hot reload.

## Testing

> Unit tests

```
npx cypress run
```

> E2E Tests (and unit tests)

```
npm run cypress open
```
